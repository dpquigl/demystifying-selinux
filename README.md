# Demystifying SELinux

This is a collection of various SELinux talks and workshops I've given over the years. Each talk is in its own subfolder and the sample vulnerable application ftransferd is contained at the top level as it is shared by all the presentations.

Talks:
* demystifying-selinux-part1: 30-minute intro to SELinux and basic issue debugging
* demystifying-selinux-part2: 4 hour workshop introducing SELinux administration and policy development.
* selinux-introduction: 1 hour intro to SELinux containing additional information about access control and SELinux fundamentals. Contains additional slides for the usecases as well.
